# Problem 1 : Classification using ResNet18 Architecture

This project focuses on solving a classification problem using the ResNet18 architecture. The goal is to accurately classify input images into predefined categories using a deep neural network. The ResNet18 architecture, renowned for its effectiveness in image classification tasks, is employed for this purpose. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing images belonging to various classes. The project involves preprocessing the data, training the ResNet18 model, and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics ROC and AUC score.
