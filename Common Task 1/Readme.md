# Common Task 1 : Classification using ResNet18 Architecture

This project focuses on solving a classification problem using the ResNet18 architecture. The goal is to accurately classify input images into predefined categories using a deep neural network. The ResNet18 architecture, renowned for its effectiveness in image classification tasks, is employed for this purpose. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing images belonging to various classes. The project involves preprocessing the data, training the ResNet18 model, and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics ROC and AUC score.
By utilizing transfer learning, the model benefits from pre-learned feature representations, leading to faster convergence and improved accuracy with minimal training overhead.
