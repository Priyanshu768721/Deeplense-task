# Specific Test III. Image Super-resolution
## Task III A
The task required training a deep learning-based super-resolution model to upscale low-resolution (LR) strong lensing images using the provided high-resolution (HR) images as ground truth. 

My Approach
To tackle this, I used SRGAN and RCAN models for their effectiveness in super-resolution tasks.
